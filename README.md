# Flutter Starter Template

This is a Flutter starter template that includes constants and reusable widgets, which you can clone and modify for your own projects.

## Getting Started

This project serves as a starting point for a Flutter application, containing reusable components that you can customize to fit your needs.

### Option 1: Clone and Use the Template

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dzrekenathan/flutter-starter-template.git
    ```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (Android Studio or VS Code).

3. Make the necessary changes in the `assets` and `lib` directories to suit your project.

4. Change the project name to match your new project name.

### Option 2: Use Template Components in Your Existing Project

1. Create a new Flutter project:
    ```bash
    flutter create <your-project-name>
    ```

2. Open the newly created project in Android Studio or VS Code.

3. Clone the starter template repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dzrekenathan/flutter-starter-template.git
    ```

4. Open the cloned template directory.

5. Copy the `assets` folder and paste it into your project's root directory.
    - The `assets` folder contains items such as fonts and images. You can modify these assets to fit your needs.

6. If you modify or add any files in the `assets` folder, make sure to update the `pubspec.yaml` file accordingly to reflect the changes.

7. Copy the `lib` folder from the starter template and replace your project's `lib` folder with it.

8. Customize and edit the subdirectories inside the `lib` folder as needed for your project.
